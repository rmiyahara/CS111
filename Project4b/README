| Included Files |
------------------
Within this submission are the following files:
lab4b.c
This file compiles with gcc to create an executable which prints out the current temperature
(measured by the temperature sensor on the BeagleBone) periodically. The executable supports
the following flags:
--period=seconds
This flag takes in an integer and sets how often the system polls for a new temperature.
--scale=[FC]
This flag sets which scale the temperature will be displayed in: (F)ahrenheit or (C)entegrade.
--log=filename
This flag will log all of the executables output into the specified file. If the file does not
exist, it will be made.
--debug
Gives the user helpful output for debugging.
The executable also takes the following commands from stdin:
SCALE=F
This command should cause all subsequent reports to be generated in degrees Fahrenheit.
SCALE=C
This command should cause all subsequent reports to be generated in degrees Centegrade
PERIOD=seconds
This command should change the number of seconds between reporting intervals. This command
does not take effect until after the next report.
STOP
This command causes the program to stop generating reports, but continues processing input
commands. If the program is not generating reports, merely logs receipt of the command.
START
This command should cause the program to, if stopped, resume generating reports. If the program is
not stopped, this merely logs a receipt of the command.
LOG line of text
This command requires no action beyond logging its receipt (the entire command, including the LOG).
OFF
This command should, like pressing the button, output (and log) a time-stamped SHUTDOWN message and
exit.

Makefile
Builds all the executables and has the following targets:
default
Compiles lab4b.c with the appropriate flags.
check
Executes an automated smoke-test of your application to see if it runs and can talk to its sensors.
clean
Deletes all files lab4b creates.
dist
Creates the submission tarball.
