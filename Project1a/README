| Included Files |
------------------
Within this submission are the following files:

lab1a.c
This code, when compiled, changes the terminal into a character-at-a-time, full duplex terminal. This
means, when each key is pressed, the program can process the character without waiting for a newline.
The executable must be used in the following format: ./lab1a [--shell=program --degbug]

The shell flag forks the program and runs its output into a designated shell. This will be "/bin/bash"
for most machines.

The debug flag gives the user numberous lines of output which helped to debug the program. The function
debug_print must be given an integer code to select a helpful output. Each code has a comment label
explaining when it should be used.

Below are the exit codes for the program. When it exits, it always provides a helpful error message
along with strerrr and its errno.
0 ... normal execution, shutdown on ^D
1 ... unrecognized argument or system call failure

Makefile
This builds the executable, cleans the working directory of files made while building the executable, 
and builds the submission. These are done using make, make clean, and make dist respectively.
