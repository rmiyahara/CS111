| Included Files |
------------------
Within this submission are the following files:

lab1b-client.c
This program, when compiled, forms an executable which connects the the lab1b-server program. This program streams the keyboard input
through a socket to the server program. Below are the flags it can take in:
--port=portnumber
This is a mandatory flag which must be set. The port must be set to a number above 2000 as anything below tends to be used by standard
services. If a port number is not specified, the program will exit.
--log=filename
This is an optional flag which logs all the of the traffic from the client to the server and from the server to the client. If a filename
is used that is not an existing file, the program will create that file and write to it.
--encrypt=encryptionkey
This optional flag encrypts all data going through the socket. It bases its cryptography on the my.key file also included in this submission.
--debug
This optional flag prints messages to the stderr which are extremely helpful when debugging this program. It calls the debug_print function
at the top of this file.


lab1b-server.c
This program, when compiled, forms an executable which connects to the lab1b-client program. This program takes the stream of data from
the client and passes it into a shell through pipes. These were the exact same pipes used in Project1A. When run, nothing will appear
on stdout as it is waiting for a connection. Below are the flags it can take in:
--port=portnumber
This is a mandatory flag which must be set. The port must be set to a number above 2000 as anything below tends to be used by standard
services. If a port number is not specified, the program will exit.
--encrypt=encryptionkey
This optional flag encrypts all data going through the socket. It bases its cryptography on the my.key file also included in this submission.
--debug
This optional flag prints messages to the stderr which are extremely helpful when debugging this program. It calls the debug_print function
at the top of this file.


Makefile
This shell script has a few commands which help to create executables, clean the directory, and make the submission:
make
This command will make both the lab1b-server and the lab1b-client executables.
make client
This command will only make the lab1b-client executable.
make server
This command will only make the lab1b-server executable.
make clean
This command will remove any executables, object files, log text files, and submissions in the working directory.
make dist
This command will make a tarball with the files in the submission.

my.key
This file contains the encryption key which I used for testing. This file was made using the following command on the SEASNet server's command
line:
dd if=/dev/urandom of=./my.key bs=1 count=16
