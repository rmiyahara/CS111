my_beaglebone.jpg
This is a selfie taken with my assembled BeagleBone. The
front of the board is shown.

connected.png
This is a screenshot from a USB terminal session. It shows
that I gave my board a name (80458599.lasr.cs.ucla.edu) and
configured network access through WiFi.

copy.png
This is a screenshot of Filezilla using sftp to move my
trivial.c program onto the BeagleBone.

build_run.png
This is a screenshot of me compiling my trivial program through
a SSH wireless connection. The output "Hello World!" is as 
expected.

git.png
This is a screenshot taken after I used the following command:
# sudo apt-get install git
to install git. The screenshot shows me cloning my CS111 repo
and using ls to display the contents. I also did this in a WiFi
SSH session.

Makefile
This shell script makes the submission, cleans the directory,
and makes the trivial program with make, make clean, and make
trivial respectively.
